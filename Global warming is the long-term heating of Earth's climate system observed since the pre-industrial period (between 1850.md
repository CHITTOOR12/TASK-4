**Global warming** is the long-term heating of Earth's **climate**
 system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900)
 due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases
 heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.Greenhouse Gases Are the Main **Reasons for Global Warming**. ... 

Cause #1: Variations in the Sun's Intensity. ... 

Cause #2: Industrial Activity. ... 

Cause #3: Agricultural Activity. ... 

Cause #4: Deforestation. ... 

Cause #**5**: Earth's  Own Feedback Loop![Global Warming vs. Climate Change | Resources – Climate Change: Vital Signs  of the Planet]

Higher temperatures are worsening many types of disasters, including storms, heat waves, floods, and droughts. A **warmer climate**
 creates an atmosphere that can collect, retain, and drop more water, 
changing weather patterns in such a way that wet areas become wetter and
 dry areas drier.
